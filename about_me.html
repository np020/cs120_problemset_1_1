    <h1>Nick Prakash</h1>
    <p>My wife and I like to travel as much as possible.  In the past four years (not including the covid
        lockdown), we have travelled to the Amalfi Coast, Bali, Thailand, Hawaii, London, and Paris.   
    </p>

    <h2>My Favorite Pets</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>A dog named Cooper</li>
        <li>A dog named Tiger</li>
        <li>A dog named Piper</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>Favorite Restaurant</h2>
    <p>My favorite restaurant is <a href="https://www.sushinoz.com/" target="_blank">Sushi Noz</a>.
        My wife and I try and go to Sushi Noz, once or twice a year mainly because we are fanatics about
        Omakase and this is one of the best in NYC.  We always have a great time here.  
    </p>

    <h2>My Favorite Food</h2>
    <img src="img/souffle.jpg" alt="Favorite Food" class="favorite-food">
    <p>I have loads of favorite foods so its tough to choose one.  But I am a sweets guy and my 
        favorite dessert of all time is a chocolate souffle
    </p>

    <h2 class="clear-float">Favorite Books</h2>
    <p>I hate to admit this but I am not an avid reader.  Most of my reading involves content for my job
        so here is the top 4 that I use / have read recently.  Not necessarily my favorties
